Bit - one binary digit, smallest data in computer system and can take either 0 or 1; 2 bits can carry 4 values: 00(0), 01(1), 10(2), 11(3)

EX: 8 bits have 2^8 = 256 values (0 - 255) -- 8 bits carries enough information for alphabet, numbers etc. All ASCII fits into 8 bits. Earlier computers grouped 8 bits into term known as Byte.

Byte - 8 bits
Kilo byte - 1024 bytes (10^3)
Mega byte - 1024^2 bytes (10^6)
Giga byte - 1024^3 bytes (10^9)

RAM - Scratchpad for computer(requires lower GB)

Hard Disk - Memory storage(requires high GB)

File - group of bytes (types of files include text(.txt), picture(.png/.jpeg), video(.mp4) etc.

Folder - collection of files

Command Prompt - where commands can be entered to carry out certain actions in windows; cd\ always typed to get to the root

md - creates directory, cd - changes directory

Absolute Path - get to any directory from anywhere by completely typing the path in Command Prompt

Eclipse - software to develop our own programs

Programs like notepad, calc. etc called IDE (Interactive Development Environment)
